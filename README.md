# Fish_detection_and_tracking
Repository that contains the main code for the development of the fish detector and tracker of the final Master Thesis of Idoia Moreno.

The code has been based on the one presented in https://github.com/phil-bergmann/tracking_wo_bnw

In this case, the repository is going to be filled with the code that has been adapted, in order to fit properly the dataset created specifically for the fish detection and tracking. 

There are three main folders:
  -  Matlab
  -  Google Colab
  -  PyCharm

Inside each one of them, there is going to be the code used with each of those tools. The code used in MATLAB, is mainly directed to the creation of the dataset. The code used in Google Colab, is the one connected to the Detection part of the system. And the code in PyCharm, is directed to the adquisition of the input video, the training of the Re-ID network and the tracking of fish.
